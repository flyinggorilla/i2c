// The Display Data Channel (DDC) bus is a two-wire communication interface compatible with the
//  IÂ²C standard (Inter-Integrated Circuit). See our online product selector matrix for availability.
//  Unlike all other interfaces, the DDC is not able to communicate in full-duplex mode, i.e. TX and RX
//  are mutually exclusive. u-blox receivers act as a slave in the communication setup, therefore they
//  cannot initiate data transfers on their own. The host, which is always master, provides the data
//  clock (SCL), and the clock frequency is therefore not configurable on the slave.
//  The receiver's DDC address is set to 0x42 by default. This address can be changed by setting the
//  mode field in UBX-CFG-PRT for DDC accordingly.
//  As the receiver will be run in slave mode and the DDC physical layer lacks a handshake mechanism
//  to inform the master about data availability, a layer has been inserted between the physical layer
//  and the UBX and NMEA layer. The receiver DDC interface implements a simple streaming
//  interface that allows the constant polling of data, discarding everything that is not parse-able.
//  The receiver returns 0xFF if no data is available. The TX-ready feature can be used to inform the
// master about data availability and can be used as a trigger for data transmission.
